# An UNofficial Python SDK and CLI for Vectara's RAG platform

It supports major features of Vectara's RAG platform for you to build your own search engine.

Additional features:

* It expands the upload function to allow you to upload a list of files or all files under a directory in one function call.
* Renders query results in beautiful Markdown printout (see `demo.ipynb`).

## Installation

```bash
# Stable
pip install vectara

# Nightly
pip install "git+https://github.com/forrestbao/vectara-python-cli.git"
```

## Usage

### Credentials

You can obtain the Vectara credentials following [this guide](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/authentication/oauth-2).
Then set up your Vectara credentials as environment variables.

```bash
# Required environment variables
export VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID=123

# API Key
export VECTARA_API_KEY=abc

# Or you can use OAuth2
export VECTARA_CLIENT_ID=abc
export VECTARA_CLIENT_SECRET=xyz

# Do not set up API Key and OAuth2 at the same time, if you set up API Key and OAuth2 at the same time, we will only use the API Key.

# optional, if you are using a proxy like LlaMasterKey https://github.com/TexteaInc/LlaMasterKey/
export VECTARA_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000/vectara"
export VECTARA_PROXY_MODE=true # Enable proxy mode
```

This unofficial SDK and CLI will read your credentials from the environment variables above. The ability to pass in credentials as arguments is also supported.

### Python

Try the Jupyter notebook `demo.ipynb` or read the docstring.

```python
from vectara import vectara

client = vectara() # get default credentials from environment variables 
                   # You can also manually pass in your credentials as arguments
                   # API Key is more important than OAuth 2, the SDK uses the API Key first, if not then fall back to OAuth2.

corpus_id = client.create_corpus('my knowledge base')

client.upload(corpus_id, 'one_file.pdf', description='My precious doc')  # add one file to the corpus 
client.upload(corpus_id, 'a_folder_of_documents') # add all files under a folder to the corpus
client.upload(corpus_id, ['user_manual.md', 'notes.txt'], description=['user manual', 'my memory']) # add a list of files to the corpus

client.query(corpus_id, 'Vectara allows me to search for anything, right?', top_k=5) # query the corpus for top 5 answers

client.reset_corpus(corpus_id) # delete all documents in the corpus
```

### Command line

To learn the command line usage, run `vectara --help`.

You must set up your Vectara credentials as environment variables before using the command line interface.

```bash
# create a corpus
vectara create_corpus 'my knowledge base'
# output: corpus_id = 12

# upload a file to the corpus
vectara upload 12 one_file.pdf # corpurs_id = 12

# upload a folder to the corpus
vectara upload 12 ./a_folder_of_documents # corpurs_id = 12

# query the corpus
vectara query 12 'Vectara allows me to search for anything, right?' --top_k=5  # corpurs_id = 12

# reset the corpus
vectara reset_corpus 12 # corpurs_id = 12
```

### Web interface via Funix

The SDK can be converted into a web interface via [Funix](http://funix.io). You can drag and drop to add a file to your Vectara corpus.

```python
pip install funix
funix src/vectara/__init__.py 
```

Then you can access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000` (the port number maybe different if port 3000 is occupied).

Below please find the screenshots.

![Create a corpus](./screenshots/create_corpus.png)

![Upload a file](./screenshots/upload.gif)

![Query the corpus](./screenshots/query.png)

**Known bugs**: Funix seems to have some memory leakage issues that the web interface may freeze after uploading a file. If that happens, please kill the process and restart the web interface.

### Stylish query results

The query results are typeset Markdown ready to be rendered. A query result includes the following info:

* A summary with citations and matching scores with respect to the query
* References cited by the summary

```markdown
### Here is the answer
To rearrange objects, you can utilize the "direction" attribute in a Funix decorator [1]. Manually resizing and positioning objects can be a tedious and inefficient process [2]. Another approach is to use a collision-free algorithm for auto-layout, where scopes will be resized to fit the objects inside [4]. An example of arranging objects in a column-reverse direction can be seen in the ChatGPT multiturn app [3]. Additionally, organizing your canvas with scopes can help in rearranging objects effectively [5]. Remember to experiment with these methods to find the best arrangement for your specific needs.
