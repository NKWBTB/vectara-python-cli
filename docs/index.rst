``vectara``, an unofficial Vectara Python SDK with CLI and GUI tools
========================================================================================

``vectara`` (``pip install vectara``) is a Python SDK/CLI/GUI that allows you to use Vectara's semantic search and knowledge-based GenAI service to find answers to your questions from massive amounts of textual data. 


Here are the resources for learning ``vectara``: 

* `A crash course of RAG and vectara <crash_course.html>`_. 
* `Reference Manual <Vectara.html>`_.
* `Demos <https://github.com/forrestbao/vectara-python-cli/tree/main/demos>`_.


`vectara-python-cli` is unofficially maintained by employees and users of Vectara.
