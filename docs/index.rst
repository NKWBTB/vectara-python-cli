``vektara``, an unofficial Vectara Python SDK with CLI
========================================================================================

``vektara`` (``pip install vektara``) is a Python SDK/CLI/GUI that allows you to use Vectara's semantic search and knowledge-based GenAI service to find answers to your questions from massive amounts of textual data. 


Here are the resources for learning ``vektara``: 

* `A crash course of RAG and vektara <crash_course.html>`_. 
* `Reference Manual <Vectara.html>`_.
* `Demos <https://github.com/forrestbao/vektara/tree/main/demos>`_.
* `GitHub <https://github.com/forrestbao/vektara>`_.


`vektara` is unofficially maintained by employees and users of Vectara.
